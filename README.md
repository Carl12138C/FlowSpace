## App description

Working environments can be disorganized and frustrating when there is a lack of management. It is essential to maintain an organized and convenient workspace to promote better and faster workflow. In our case, we find a lack of technology that supports all functions and needs in a workspace such as task delegation, team communication, and polls for decision-making. We want to create an app that supports multiple features such that everything will be consolidated and organized. 

Introducing FlowSpace, our application will consolidate the processes involved in a workspace in a seamless environment to create a common ground for better communication and more efficient workflow. 

#### You will be able to:

  * Communicate with your team members 
  
  * View your assigned task
  
  * Create task for people within your group
  
  * Create polls
  
  * Use Artifical Intelligence to have a more efficient flow.
  
  * View a Calendar with all your task.
